Principles:
- History ultimately flows from the cumulative direction of everyone's actions
- This is untenable to work with, but we approximate by assuming action that benefits the individual
- These individuals are accumulated into groups based on positions in different hierarchies which determine their optimal behavior (class, race, etc.)
- This is a fair assumption because high-power groups (which control the direction of societal action) have similar views that preserve and protect the power structure
	- Why? [[Study]]
	- Power structures that have been around this long must be self preserving, and they do this by rewarding the most power to those that maintain the stucture
		- PROBLEM: This explains past behavior, but why should we expect that these structures keep acting this way?
- This "optimal behavior" or gradient can be read from the material conditions of the society, hence materialism
Failures:
- Doesn't account for "revolutions" - events that significantly alter the composition and structure of power hierarchies
	- How does historical materialism understand these shifts in theory? What predicts them?
- Why do power structures not fall away?
There are idealist explanations for both of the previous, but of course, we would like an explanation not based in "ideas" (if possible).
