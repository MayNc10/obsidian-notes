### Engels

- "Authority, in the sense in which the word is used here, means: the imposition of the will of another upon ours"
	- I think right off, this is an obfuscating definition, but we'll play along
- "Thereafter particular questions arise in each room and at every moment concerning the mode of production, distribution of material, etc., which must be settled by decision of a delegate placed at the head of each branch of labour or, if possible, by a majority vote, the will of the single individual will always have to subordinate itself, which means that questions are settled in an authoritarian way"
	- This is why the above definition is dishonest. If everybody *agrees* to the rules laid out, by vote or point person or whatever, then I would argue that is *not* authoritarianism. Maybe you can argue that authoritarianism is *required* to ensure efficiency, but this isn't Engels' argument here
- "Here, too, the first condition of the job is a dominant will that settles all subordinate questions, whether this will is represented by a single delegate or a committee charged with the execution of the resolutions of the majority of persona interested. In either case there is a very pronounced authority."
	- Engels forgets that people can agree to things
- "All Socialists are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society."
	- Unfortunately, it didn't really turn out like this. sorry!
- "Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon â€” authoritarian means, if such there be at all"
	- Anti-intellectual - I believe that you can evaluate a revolution's authoritarian character by identifying the power structures it seeks to change; If a revolution works *against* an existing social hierarchy, if it has the goal to abolish this hierarchy, then the violence employed is simple self-defense on a larger scale.
