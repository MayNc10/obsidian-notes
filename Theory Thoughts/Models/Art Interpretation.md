- Following from [[Perspectives and Algebra]], we view this situation as an algebra
- Actually, the simplest algebra, a linear algebra with a vector space
- Interpretations as certain vectors in a high-dimensional space
$$\vec{i} = I(A)$$
- We also have initial interpretation $\vec{i_o} = I_o(A)$
- The way I understand the correctness of an interpretation is
$$C(I) = \mathop{sgn}(\vec{i} \cdot \vec{i_o})$$
i.e., the correctness of an interpretation is how it corresponds to the intention, or original interpretation by the artist. A perspective, interpretation, set of themes or messages that directly contradicts the original intention is nonsensical. A relative valuation can be given by
$$V(I) \approx \begin{cases} \frac{1}{\vec{i} \cdot \vec{i_o}} & \vec{i} \cdot \vec{i_o} > 0 \\ \ln\left(\frac{-1}{k(\vec{i} \cdot \vec{i_o})}-1\right) & \vec{i} \cdot \vec{i_o} < 0 \end{cases}$$
For some large integer $k$. This equation assigns largest value to interpretations are entire perpendicular to the original intention. I think these are the most interesting because the situation which produces these interpretation acts as a morphisms between two discreet conceptions/models of reality, which is a really interesting thing to have. This continues across the sign barrier because even if an interpretation has a few conflicts, if they're extremely minor it doesn't matter. However, they quickly snowball, and so even a slightly negative dot product corresponds to a very low value interpretation.
