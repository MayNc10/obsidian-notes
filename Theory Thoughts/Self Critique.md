aka things my beliefs suggest that don't seem true

- if the only way forward for the workers is to destroy capitalism and the bourgeoise, how does that map to other oppressions like racial or gendered? I've always self defined Man as the class that benefits from gendered oppression (and vice versa), does that mean that "men" have to be destroyed? How would that work?
