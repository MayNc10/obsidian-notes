Proposes to conduct a study to create laws in accordance with [[Reinforcement of Systems]]

Two parts:
- Determine a subject's relative privilege within a system
- Determine a subject's willingness to enforce violence pertaining to that system

These questions listed are not how they would be phrased, for the record

Systems to Study:
- Capitalism/Classism
	- First part - fairly easy
		- Important to  note, we want placement on two related but separate scales - rich/poor, and bourgeois/proletarian 
		- First scale can be gauged with questions about income
			- Anything else
		- Second gauge
			- Family member/self were/are company owners?
			- X were management?
			- Types of jobs that relations have?
			- Job security?
			- Current employment?
	- Second - should also be relatively easy
		- First
			- Violence in classism is how the subject treats poor people, generally
			- What do they think of homeless people? drug users?
			- Do they go out of their way to avoid "bad neighborhoods?"
			- Do they fear theft? Have they ever been stolen from?
			- etc.
		- Second
			- Violence in class relations is how they respond to workers self-determination
			- Opinions on capitalism/communism?
			- Opinions on unions?
			- Do all workers have the right to strike?
			- etc.
- Patriarchy
- White Supremacy


Expected results:

$\forall \mathcal{V}: \frac{d\mu(M)}{dM} > 0$ - I expect the average of willingness for violence to increase with material benefit 
$\forall \mathcal{V}: \frac{d\sigma^2(M)}{dM} < 0$ - I expect the variance of the violence distribution to decrease with material benefit
