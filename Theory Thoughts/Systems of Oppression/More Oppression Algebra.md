Using definitions in [[Oppression as a Lattice]]

$$C_1 \lor C_2 = C_1 \implies \mathcal{M}(C_1) < \mathcal{M}(C_2)$$
$$C_1 \land C_2 = C_1 \implies \mathcal{M}(C_1) > \mathcal{M}(C_2)$$
$\mathcal{M}$ is a measuring function in some context or situation
We can write $\mathcal{M}$ as 
$$\mathcal{M} = \sum_k \mu_k(S), S \in \mathcal{P}(C)$$
where $\mu(\mathbb{R}^n) > 0$, $\forall i \in [1, n], \hat{\mathbf{e}}_i \cdot \nabla \mu > 0$

idk what i thought it was like some combination of functions 
where hierarchies map to indices
and so if you increase the indices obviously it goes down
but if one is bigger and one is smaller its indeterminate or smth
