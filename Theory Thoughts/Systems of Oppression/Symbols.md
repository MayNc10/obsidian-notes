# Definitions

$S$ = System
$I$ = an Individual
$I_S$ = an Individual who benefits from the System
$I_{\neg S}$ = an Individual who benefits from the System
$P_S(G_1, G_2)$( = Power (or Privilege) differential between two individuals (or categories of individuals) (come up with a symbol for that)
	power cannot be directly measured, and it doesn't make sense to think about it that way. Can you ask about the power of a white person compared to a gay person? not really
	 power differntials are only defined for some pairs of categories
$R_S(I)$ = the amount an Individual Reinforces the System
$O$ = an oppression
$O_i$ = an Intersectional oppression



# Theorems

$$\frac{\partial P_S}{\partial R_S}  > 0 $$
$$ O_i = O_1 * O_2 $$
$$ \exists O_i \in S \implies \exists O_1 \in S, \exists O_2 \in S $$ Is the above true? Or can intersectional oppressions be separated from their components? research!
