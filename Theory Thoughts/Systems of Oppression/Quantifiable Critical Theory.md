This is the current name I'm using for this system of understanding I'm building up, where I attempt to describe the claims of critical & marxist theories in terms of mathematical formal logic

Areas:
- [[Oppression as a Lattice]], [[More Oppression Algebra]] are attempting to 
	- Articulate the claims of intersectional theory in terms of sets 
	- Expand what we can claim to understand about the relationship between different hierarchical categories through data analysis and theoretical foundation
- [[Reinforcement of Systems]]
	- Needs to be rewritten, but understanding the relationship between  those who believe in the claims of an ideology about the material world and those who benefit from it. This is less an attempt to describe something new and instead to quantify and test a relationship I believe is already quite obviously true
- [[Pressure Gradients]]
	- Again needs to be rewritten, but understands violence as a "force" required in order to maintain a "structurally unfavorable" system of privilege. In this view, it would be the natural tendency of groups and categories to blend together and lose material distinction, and so violence is required in order to maintain a hierarchy. The metaphor here is chemical pressure (or low-entropy arrangements of molecules), in which the natural tendency of the system is to form a smooth balanced gradient unless force is applied.
