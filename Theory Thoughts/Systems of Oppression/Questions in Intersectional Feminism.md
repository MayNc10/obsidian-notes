1. Is it even possible for there to be a power structure in which misogyny does not exist but transphobia does?
2. It *is* possible to conceive of a power structure where there is racism but no misogyny. Is it possible (not that we'd want to) to get from our current white supremacist patriarchy to that theoretical system?
3. Can these questions be thought of in terms of graph or knot theory?
