# Definitions

Categories, Hierarchies, and Power functions (see [[Intersectionality]])
The Exploitation rate for a given power dynamic $P$ is $E_P$, and acceptance rate is $A_P$

# Theorems
 A hierarchy's power $P(h)$ can be changed, and the way it changes is very important
One key fact is that the more a power difference is exploited, the more powerful it becomes

$$ P(h) = X(E_P, A_P) $$where $X$ is a function satisfying the following conditions
$$\frac{\partial X}{E_P} > 0$$ $$\frac{\partial X}{A_P} > 0$$
$$X(0, E_p) = 0$$

$$X(0, A_p) = 0$$
This has interesting implications (I hope)
Firstly, consider an intersectional oppression system in which $P= P_i(\{h_1', h_2^0\}, \{h_1', h_2'\})$
When this power differential is exploited, $E_P$ increases, (someone using our rules imply that the hierarchies at play must change)
