- Find the min and max points, create inscribed quad
- remove points inside quad, do the same procedure for the triangles 
- keep going 
What's the max error at each step

Worst shape to attempt is a limit to a square (not actually a square tho bc then we get it instantly)
Err step 1 

$\frac{E_1}{A} = 1/2, \frac{E_2}{A} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4}$ 

$$\frac{E_n}{A} = \sum_{k}$$
