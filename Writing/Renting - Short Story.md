- First Person
- outline:
	- main character is trying to find a place to live off campus
		- college is kicking you out to "make you be your own person"
	- rents house from a person
	- they are exploitative sometimes
	- just an ass of a landlord
	- has friend
	- friend needs a place to live
		- her friends are assholes 
	- "Well, I'm studying abroad for a semester, so you can sublet"
	- MC is kind of exploitative to "friend"
		- friend is emotionally dependent on MC
	- maybe subletter is revealed to be trans and this causes conflict, MC feels betrayed, subletter feels betrayed bc she thought MC was trans (is MC trans?)
	- [more stuff?]
	- story ends with betrayal - subletter tells landlord MC is violating her contract, MC comes back from study abroad to find she's being moved out.
- very inspired by "Not Bleak"
- contrast between living space/private mind
	- renting puts your mind and personhood at risk
	- you could be dehumanized any moment
- characters working against interest
	- MC's mistreatment of SL leads to MC's downfall
	- SL is trans, so comment on how 
		- either MC is trans, so fuck conformism/transmed
		- MC isn't trans, reinforcing transmisogyny also reinforces general misogyny

#### First attempt
	It's September, and I'm desperately searching for a home. The university doesn't allow students to live on campus after second year - they say it's to "encourage students to become more independant", I personally think their motivations are likely more selfish but I digress - and the rush to find a house for next year starts extremely early. Hundreds of students scrambling for cheap rentals in a suburb isn't very condusive to an efficient or relaxing process. If you know an upperclassman you can get the lease passed down to you, but I only have a few friends, and they're all in my year. I would try to live with them, but they've already found a decent flat, and I wouldn't fit. I don't mind. Too much. I'm a little miffed, to be honest, but you can't always get the people you'd want, and I'm fine with them. They're nice people. Anyway - back to housing. I was lucky enough to stumble upon an open room - and room is accurate; 1 bed 1 bath and [x] feet is enough for one person, but not much more than that. Maybe enough space for a few rats as well. The landlord is a middle-aged woman named Ms. Lewis. I don't know her first name, and I don't particularly want to. She doesn't seem like a very kind person, which may explain why she's spending her autumn months figuring out how to rip off college kids, instead of doing whatever else older people do (I'm too worried about what I'm doing myself to really notice whatever it is they get up to). Nice or not, she does have an opening, and I'm willing to take it. I send her my information, and pray that this will be the last time. 

	I meet with her a few days later, a quiet Wednesday afternoon, a day I don't have many classes. The house is about a 10 minute walk from campus, which isn't that bad. I've heard stories of people having to buy bicycles just to have a hope of getting to classes on time. The house is two stories, and it seems to have been completely converted into rooms just like mine. There's a communal kitchen, but all other rooms have been converted to sleeping spaces. There's a double on the first floor in what I suspect used to be the living room. My place is on the second floor, which seems to be quieter. There's someone else on this floor as well, but they're across the stairway from me, so I suspect (hope) the sound won't travel enough to wake me. I don't have the greatest sleep schedule, so whatever rest I manage to get needs to be undisturbed. It's a bit bitter than my current room, with its own small bathroom. I'm kind of excited to be honest. Having my own place is quite the change. 
		Well, not mine yet. I go back down the stairs and make my way to the kitchen table to meet with Ms. Lewis. [...]

		[sophmore year, relation with lewis]
		[meeting chloe, getting to know her, offering sublet for next semester]
		[betrayal of alcohol]
		[trans outing?]
		[chloe backstab - figure out power relations]

	I don't meet Chloe until the following semester. It's the first day of my theoretical computer science class, and as I file in to the small room, I notice her (her? her) staring at me from her chair in the table. I don't acknowledge her, but she notices I've seen her. She says nothing. The class begins
	I catch her on the way out. It's a small class, so I suspect we'll probably work together on one project or another at some point, and I'd like to be sure she won't kill me, or more likely, ghost my requests to meet and discuss our progress. 
		"Hey, do you have a second to chat before the next block?" I ask. 
		"S-Sure" she stammers out. 
	We walk over to an empty hallway adjacent to the exit. 
		"Did I do something to offend you? Making an enemy first day isn't on my class syllabus"
		"No, sorry for staring at you. I just - you seemed nicer than the rest of them"
		"No need to be afraid of them, I promise. They're CS kids, the worst they could do would be insulting your intelligence in ways that leave those around them more confused than amused. You're fine"
		"Well, I'm just worried since im. Y'know. A first year and all"
		"You're a freshman? How did you get in this class? Aren't there prerequesits?"
		"I met with the professor last semester, and I guess he liked me enough that he invited me to join the class"
		"Well, I'm sure you'll do fine. See ya round"
