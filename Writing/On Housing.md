Thoughts about the flood and our homes?

## Low Hanging Fruit

### Housing in Society

 Houses represent the aspirations of the "normal" US citizen - white picket fence house in the suburbs (unless you aren't white)

Houses are a manifestation of capitalistic "individuality" 
	all private houses, all spaces to ourselves, but each the same
	 indivi - duality?

... and so are also a manifestation of our alienation, from each other and from the environment

### Housing Conceptually

indivi - duality - duality of man and nature
	duality of mind and body
	a place where we store our secrets, our information
	 just like we separate the mind from the body, we can protect our mind 
			and so the flood is terrifying because
			it reveals that we are not separate from the environment
			and the mind is not separate from the body
			the flood enters and destroys our secrets, our creations, what is "ours"
	 duality - the man has the house, nature doesn't
		 so what if you are a person without a home? you are deprived of your humanity

we are terrified of invasions of the mind
	mind control and truth serums and body snatching and etc.

homes locate us
not just through an address
you home is "where you come from"
homelessness can be aspirational - the wanderer, the seeker, the traveler, the hippie
changing our location changes us
## Higher Aspirations

indivi - duality
in - divi(ne) - duality
dualism in religion? 
	janus - the god of entrances and exits
		physical and metaphorical
		doors mark the beginning (also janus) of the home
divi - ni = masculine plural of divino
invidi = inflection of invidiare
	to envy
	invidia - envy (noun)

duality of man and god? like man and environment
	what does this parallel reveal?
	man is nature "tamed", god is man "tamed"
	we serve god and nature serves us

invidi = envy
	what do we envy?
	does the privacy spawn jealousy?
	grass is greener on the other side
	of the fence - home divide

## Implications

what should housing be like
conflicting feelings
	the desire for "our space", a manifestation of the privacy of our mind
	 private homes = individuality = isolation = alienation
	 and the myth that our homes can be private
		 the flood!
		 the flood!

need a new form of housing
flexible
yours but not only yours
let others in
	just like your mind - you have to share sometimes
		mental isolation just as dangerous

MORE! MORE! MORE! MORE!
## Communcation

Short story? novel?
Song
	could be lyrics
		but then i gotta make a beat :(

whats the construction?
the central conceit?
